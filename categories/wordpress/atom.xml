    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was creating a Wordpress child theme (the best way to modify/override your themes) tonight and had the need to have different display options depending on which categories the blog article had. So for example if I had a post categorised with "portfolio", I wanted to hide the comments form which usually sits at the bottom of a post.</p>

<p>The following snippet will loop over all post categories, if it finds that "portfolio" is one of the categories assigned to the current post then a local variable (boolean) is set which you can use to hide Wordpress functions anywhere in the current template.</p>

<p>``` php
&lt;?php</p>

<pre><code>$isPortfolio = false;

$categories = get_the_category();

foreach($categories as $cat)
{
    if ($cat-&gt;cat_name == 'portfolio')
    {
        $isPortfolio = true;
        break;
    }       
}
</code></pre>

<p>?>
```</p>

<p>These changes were at the top of my child theme's <em>single.php</em> template. Not displaying the comments form was as simple as:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?php if (!$isPortfolio){comments_template('', true);} ?&gt;
</code></p>

<h2>Update 12th May 2011</h2>

<p>Thanks to Martin in the comments below for alerting me to the fact that Wordpress already has something for this, has_category($category, $post);</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?php $isPortfolio = has_category('portfolio'); ?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Note I didn't need the 2nd argument as it defaults to the current post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just spent some time figuring out why fancybox wasn't working tonight (image thumbnails were just linking to the large image...not loading the overlay as they should). It now seems obvious after the fact but as far as I can see it's NOT in the fancybox docs.</p>

<p>When you insert your gallery from the media section of a page in wp-admin, you HAVE to choose "Image File", not "Attachment Page". That's it!</p>

<p>Annoyingly if you set the option to "Image File", save and exit...the next time you edit the page Wordpress doesn't remember your decision and instead checks the "Attachment Page" radio option.</p>

<p>Hope this helps some people :)</p>

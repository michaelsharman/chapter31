    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had some new fonts to install on our test server that runs Ubuntu server. Pretty simple really, just noting it down here for next time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upload/ssh the font(s) to your home folder on the server</li>
<li>Copy font to the system fonts folder, this way it can be used by all users on the system

<pre><code>sudo cp -R ~/trade-gothic /usr/share/fonts/truetype/    
</code></pre></li>
<li>Check permissions

<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/trade-gothic/
</code></pre></li>
<li>Install the fonts so applications can use them

<pre><code>sudo fc-cache -f -v
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just setup my machine at home with Ubuntu 8.10 (desktop) which was so easy think I saved hours off the time it would normally take with Windows. So much is already installed and ready to go and with apt (or the Synaptic package manager) it's super quick to download and install extra things things like MySQL, PHP, Apache, Java etc</p>

<p>Here are some notes which helped me out when configuring some of these development tools.</p>

<p>This assumes you've already installed Apache and MySQL, for notes on installing these I <a href="http://ubuntuexperiment.wordpress.com/2008/11/10/installing-apache-php-mysql/">found this article</a> to be a great resource.</p>

<p>If you get this message when you restart Apache, "<em>Could not reliably determine the serverâ€™s fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName</em>", edit /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn and add "ServerName localhost":</p>

<p><code>
sudo nano /etc/apache2/conf.d/fqdn
</code></p>

<p><strong>Load the mod_rewrite module for Apache</strong></p>

<p><code>
sudo a2enmod rewrite
</code></p>

<p><strong>Enable your Apache vhosts</strong></p>

<p>I already had all my vhosts defined in separate <em>.conf</em> files on my windows box, so I copied them all into /etc/apache2/sites-available and setup symbolic links from my /etc/apache2/sites-enabled:</p>

<p><code>
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/mysite.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/mysite.conf
</code></p>

<p><strong>Download and install PHP</strong></p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5
</code></p>

<p><strong>PHP connector to MySQL</strong></p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-auth-mysql php5-mysql
</code></p>

<p><strong>Install MySQL Administrator</strong></p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install mysql-admin
</code></p>

<p><strong>Install subversion</strong></p>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install subversion
</code></p>

<p>I am also using <a href="http://www.poweredbypulse.com/">Pulse</a> to manage my <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">eclipse</a> development environment so I needed Java which I got from the Synaptic Package Manager (<em>sun-java6-bin</em>). Pulse is super cool, I used the standard cfeclipse profile with the addition of the PHP PDT (for developing in PHP).</p>

    <id>http://chapter31.com/2008/02/28/cant-access-shared-music-with-rhythmbox-ubuntu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Probably quite old news for those in the know, but if you're using Rhythmbox to play music on Ubuntu and want to listen to shared music over a network where people are using iTunes version 7+....it ain't going to work :(</p>

<p>You can view who is sharing music, but their actual libraries won't load into Rhythmbox. In this case it's not a compatibility between OS's etc, it's purely proprietary :(</p>

<p>The only way to access iTunes shares is by (yep) using iTunes. I guess that counts out Ubuntu users.</p>

<blockquote><p>With the release of iTunes 7.0, Apple changed their implementation of DAAP. This change prevents any third-party client, such as a computer running Linux, a modified Xbox, or any computer without iTunes installed, from connecting to a remote iTunes repository. iTunes will still connect as a client to other iTunes servers and to third-party servers</p></blockquote>

<p>Go Apple! You rock :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/utils/gnash">Gnash</a> is a free Flash movie player for Ubuntu which works as a standalone player or as a plugin for Firefox and Konqueror.</p>

<p>This is the default (I believe) player installed on Ubuntu 7.10 (the Adobe player isn't there by default).</p>

<p>I recently tried to load a Flex app in this player and failed, the reason is that Gnash is in alpha state and supports Flash version 7 (and some AS classes for 8.5) only.</p>

<p>Of course you need Flash player 9 to run Flex 2+, so you'll have to use Adobe's Flash player for now which thankfully works fine :)</p>

<p>To install the Flash player from the terminal:</p>

<p><code>javascript
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
</code></p>

<p>Or to try Gnash:</p>

<p><code>javascript
sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-gnash
</code></p>

<p>This will be another interesting project to keep an eye on.</p>

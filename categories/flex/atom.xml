    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok this was annoying...I had an older trial version of the standalone Flex Builder 3 on my system (Mac 10.5) and wanted to activate it with a new serial for FB3 Professional.</p>

<p>Whenever I entered the serial in "Help -> Manage Flex Licenses" I kept getting a message saying "Invalid serial number" even though it was a brand new serial. Damn.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lynchconsulting.com.au/go/blog">Mark</a> gave me the original hint to remove the <em>license.properties</em> file under <em>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Flex</em> but FB wasn't re-creating it when I entered my serial on startup. I needed to create the file manually and enter my serial number. These steps got me going:</p>

<ul>
<li>cd /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Flex</li>
<li>sudo touch license.properties (create the file)</li>
<li>sudo nano license.properties (edit the file)</li>
<li>enter the following "flexbuilder3=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" (where xxx etc is your actual serial)</li>
<li>restart Flex Builder</li>
</ul>


<p>Also thanks to <a href="http://62five.com/blog/?p=26">62five.com</a> for the post.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Areez Gangji has just posted on <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/">Adobe devnet</a> an article listing the "<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/articles/apps_students.html">Top 10 Adobe Flex and AIR applications for students</a>".</p>

<p>I'm very proud to say that a good friend (and fellow <a href="http://www.daemon.com.au/">Daemon</a> alumni) <a href="http://mxbase.blogspot.com/">Patrick Tai</a> has an app on their called <a href="http://mooflair.com/">mooFlair</a> which he originally built for the AIR derby.</p>

<p>What is mooFlair?</p>

<blockquote><p>A desktop application that helps you to manage and watch both online and offline FLVs videos. More than a simple flv player, build your own FLV library and save your compilations in playlists.
Import FLVs from your computer - including h.264 encoded videos, browse categorised RSS Feeds or search directly from the most popular video content providers and add new video clips to your searchable library. If you need to watch all your videos off line, simply use the download option.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rss feeds and search are available for the following content providers:</p>

<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>BlipTv</li>
<li>Dailymotion</li>
<li>Metacafe</li>
<li>5min Life Videopedia</li>
<li>SpikedHumour</li>
</ul>


<p>I've been using mooFlair for a while now and it's fantastic. Check it out, there's even an <a href="http://mooflair.com/demo/index.html">online demo</a> to try :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/feisty/utils/gnash">Gnash</a> is a free Flash movie player for Ubuntu which works as a standalone player or as a plugin for Firefox and Konqueror.</p>

<p>This is the default (I believe) player installed on Ubuntu 7.10 (the Adobe player isn't there by default).</p>

<p>I recently tried to load a Flex app in this player and failed, the reason is that Gnash is in alpha state and supports Flash version 7 (and some AS classes for 8.5) only.</p>

<p>Of course you need Flash player 9 to run Flex 2+, so you'll have to use Adobe's Flash player for now which thankfully works fine :)</p>

<p>To install the Flash player from the terminal:</p>

<p><code>javascript
sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
</code></p>

<p>Or to try Gnash:</p>

<p><code>javascript
sudo apt-get install mozilla-plugin-gnash
</code></p>

<p>This will be another interesting project to keep an eye on.</p>

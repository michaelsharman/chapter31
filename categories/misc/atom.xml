    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had some new fonts to install on our test server that runs Ubuntu server. Pretty simple really, just noting it down here for next time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upload/ssh the font(s) to your home folder on the server</li>
<li>Copy font to the system fonts folder, this way it can be used by all users on the system

<pre><code>sudo cp -R ~/trade-gothic /usr/share/fonts/truetype/    
</code></pre></li>
<li>Check permissions

<pre><code>sudo chmod 755 /usr/share/fonts/truetype/trade-gothic/
</code></pre></li>
<li>Install the fonts so applications can use them

<pre><code>sudo fc-cache -f -v
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

    <id>http://chapter31.com/2012/07/05/jquery-tinymce-issue-with-attr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had some strange behaviour with the jQuery verion of tinyMCE (3.4.6). Basically I was <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/">integrating the chosen library</a>Â (which is build as a jQuery plugin), but it seems the $.attr('id') from within chosen.js was returning a JavaScript element reference instead of the value of the "id" field.</p>

<p><a href="/images/uploads/2012/07/tiny_error.png"><img src="/images/uploads/2012/07/tiny_error.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Some basic tracing showed the strange error:</p>

<p><a href="/images/uploads/2012/07/tiny_trace.png"><img src="/images/uploads/2012/07/tiny_trace.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The solution for me was moving to tinyMCE 3.5.4.1 (and jQuery 1.7.2, previously I was on 1.6.4). All good now, just thought I'd throw up a quick post if anyone was being caught by this.</p>

    <id>http://chapter31.com/2010/05/10/ie-and-underscores-in-domain-names</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ok, a short warning to those who use underscores in their domain names. Underscores you say? Aren't they illegal characters in domain names? Why yes they are (but I think they're valid in sub-domains...not sure), but you may find yourself using them in development environments, particularly if you're doing a re-design. Think something like <em>http://mysite_v2.local/</em> etc</p>

<p>Now, this works of course and everything is fine and dandy because your using your own hosts file to make it "legal"...except that Internet Explorer has this little quirk where it doesn't persist your session (cookie) information. So your app sets some session variables, refresh the page and they're gone. Sigh...</p>

<p>Why would IE even bother to do this? Who knows. But keep this in mind next time your pulling your hair out trying to figure out why session management isn't working for you in IE.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong></p>

<p>Don't ever use underscores in domain names</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm probably a bit behind the times with this one, but Adobe have added "BrowserLab" functionality to "<em>preview and test your web pages on leading browsers and operating systems - on demand</em>".</p>

<p>Seems to work like other paid services, but is free :)</p>

<p><a href="https://browserlab.adobe.com/">https://browserlab.adobe.com/</a></p>

<p>Available browser options (across mac and windows) include:</p>

<ul>
<li>IE 6/7/8</li>
<li>Firefox 2/3</li>
<li>Safari 3/4</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hmm it seems firefox (Windows) 3.5.2 has decided to change the default location for downloading files. Used to be the desktop, but if you suddenly discover that you can't find things you've download you might want to head to Tools->Options in firefox.</p>

<p>If you see "Downloads" as the chosen folder (as below), you can change it back to the desktop.</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/2009/08/ffdownload.jpg" alt="ffdownload" /></p>

<p>Safari (at least on the Mac) also annoyingly places files there.</p>

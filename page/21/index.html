			Wordpress RSS Feed Validation</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> for a while now and I&#8217;m really happy with it. Only recently have I tried to validate my RSS feed using <a href="http://www.feedvalidator.org/">feedvalidator</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately even though the feed validated I received the following warning:</p>

<blockquote><p>wfw:commentRSS should be wfw:commentRss</p></blockquote>

<p>The explanation given on the site was:</p>

<blockquote><p>Due to a clerical error, the element Chris Sells originally spec&#8217;ed as wfw:commentRss appeared as wfw:commentRSS (note the difference in case) on Joe Gregorio&#8217;s site. At least one product (WordPress) has implemented and deployed feeds using the spelling originally present on Joe&#8217;s site.</p></blockquote>

<p>And the solution:</p>

<blockquote><p>Change wfw:commentRSS to wfw:commentRss</p>

<p>Wordpress users can find this in the wp-rss2.php file.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gotta love nice and easy fixes :)</p>

			Lightweight Notepad Replacements</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Usually when developing you have all your relevant development files contained within a central project directory, so you can of course access any file you want from within your IDE environment.</p>

<p>Sometimes however (and this is very often for me) you want to open a file (or bunch of files) which don&#8217;t exist in a current &#8216;project&#8217;, or you may want a scratch pad to work with for quick notes. Those familiar with eclipse (and cfeclipse) will recognise that this can be troublesome as you can&#8217;t easily open a file which is outside a project. Yes you can use the File Explorer View to do this, but it&#8217;s just not simple enough. Dreamweaver and Homesite are a little better at this, but all 3 can be a little slow to load if you don&#8217;t already have them open.</p>

<p>There are a couple of free lightweight alternatives to assist you which mean you can quickly and easily open files without resorting to notepad (ugh!).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</a> is super quick, tiny and has some great features including:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syntax highlighting</p></li>
<li><p>Multi-level undo / redo</p></li>
<li><p>Directory tree view window</p></li>
<li><p>Column mode editing (WHY don&#8217;t more editors have this?)</p></li>
<li><p>Spell checker</p></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm">Notepad++</a> is another similar editor with a similar feature set. It&#8217;s worth your time taking a look at these for certain situations due to the fact that they are so lightweight and powerful.</p>

			Reserved Characters in HTML &#8216;Id&#8217; Attribute</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Currently I&#8217;m building an app which will accept metadata from different sources, translate that into an API to dynamically build an HTML form from. Everything is going just dandy until my page stopped validating (I use tidy to validate my markup) when I got the following warning:</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/2006/11/id_warning.gif" alt="id_warning.gif" /></p>

<p>After some digging I discovered that the value of the &#8216;id&#8217; attribute in not simply a string which you can put anything into. I found this on w3c:</p>

<blockquote><p>ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens (&#8220;-&#8220;), underscores (&#8220;_&#8221;), colons (&#8220;:&#8221;), and periods (&#8220;.&#8221;).</p></blockquote>

<p>A simple replace got me around the solution:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>sMyString.replaceAll("/", "_");</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Luckily this was a quick fix and a lesson learned! <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html">Click here to view the w3c resource</a>.</p>

			Cheap ColdFusion Hosting?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>ColdFusion hosting (shared) certainly isn&#8217;t as ubiquitous as say PHP, but there are some well known hosting providers that you can use particuarly for smaller clients on a budget.</p>

<p>Some of the more popular ones are <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com/">Hostmysite</a> and <a href="http://www.crystaltech.com/">Crystal Tech</a>. Last week some colleagues turned me on to <a href="http://www.hostingatoz.com/">Hosting A to Z</a> who are the cheapest I&#8217;ve ever seen, with prices as low as USD$34.99 a year (not a month&#8230;a year!). That particular plan includes 1 MSSQL database, free setup fee and reasonable traffic. Only 500MB of disk space though which may be a problem for some sites.</p>

<p>As usual there are concerns when putting your site on a shared host, performance probably being at the top of the list. Other concerns may be things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Amount of RAM</li>
<li>CPU</li>
<li>Other clients/applications running (and typing up resources)</li>
<li>Network speeds</li>
<li>Database connectivity and speeds</li>
<li>Disaster Recovery</li>
<li>Stats package</li>
<li>etc al</li>
</ul>


<p>hostingatoz run Intel Xeon&#8217;s with 2.8 to 3.2 CPU&#8217;s with 2-4GB of RAM, boast 99.9% uptime and 24 x 7 x 365 customer support. Not too bad for the price. Oh and by the way, they run ColdFusion MX 7 Enterprise.</p>

<p>The only thing for me is that I&#8217;d never heard of them. In itself that certainly isn&#8217;t a reason not to try them, but I do know that a LOT of people use hostmysite and crystaltech and I&#8217;ve generally heard good things about them.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.hostingatoz.com/shared_hosting.cfx">read more here</a>. Happy hosting :)</p>

			Browser Testing Your Site Design</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I&#8217;ve often used <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">browsercam</a> for testing my sites in different browsers on different operating systems. So I can pass a URL (which must be publicly available) and see screenshot results on Windows, Linux and Mac across just about any browser you like&#8230;from Flock to Firefox and Safari to Konqueror. A full browser list can be <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/Features.aspx#Browsers">seen here</a>.</p>

<p>Now browsercam is also cool because it lets you devicecheck, meaning testing your site on Blackberries or Windows Mobile&#8230;nice :) Only problem is that browsercam is commercial, so if you&#8217;re a sole trader you may not have the budget for what is such an ESSENTIAL part of web development. You absolutely and categorically <strong>must check your sites in different browsers and operating systems</strong>!</p>

<p>Thankfully there is a free tool out there to help you out. <a href="http://browsershots.org/">Browser Shots</a> does pretty much the same thing as Browser Cam minus the cost of course. Testing is available for Windows, Mac and various flavours of Linux with a tonne of browsers!</p>

<p>The only possible downside is that your screen shots are publically viewable. If that&#8217;s not an option you may need to use something else.</p>

			Caching Stored Procedures</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Stored procedures are great for many reasons but one of the reasons I might not use them is you can&#8217;t cache them&#8230;or can you?</p>

<p>A discussion at work enlightened me to a simple way around the lack of the cachedwithin attribute inside the <cfstoredproc> tag. Simply use the <cfquery> tag instead!</p>

<p>Ok, so normally if I wanted to use a stored procedure I might do something like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">cfstoredproc</span> <span class="nx">procedure</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;qGetUser&quot;</span> <span class="nx">datasource</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#application.dsn#&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">cfprocparam</span> <span class="nx">cfsqltype</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;CF_SQL_INTEGER&quot;</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;false&quot;</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;in&quot;</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#arguments.userId#&quot;</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/cfstoredproc&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>But did you know that you can execute your stored procedures from within the <cfquery> tag? Well you can, that way you can also take advantage of the cachedwithin attribute!:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">cfquery</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;qGetUser&quot;</span> <span class="nx">datasource</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#application.dsn#&quot;</span> <span class="nx">cachedwithin</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;#createTimeSpan(0,2,0,0)#&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">exec</span> <span class="nx">usp_getUser</span> <span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">arguments</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">userId</span><span class="err">#</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/cfquery&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>One thing though is that this will only work when you return a <strong>single record set</strong>, if you need to return multiple record sets (which I often do) then <cfstoredproc> is your only option as you can use the <cfprocresult> tag like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cfprocresult name="myResultOne" resultset="2" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It always amazes me when you get simple solutions to problems you have using what you already know in a creative way, at least creative or new to you!</p>

<p>Always look to refactor your code, you never know what you&#8217;ll learn to save you time and effort in the future :)</p>

			Alternatives to Adobe ColdFusion Server?</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For as long as I can remember there has been heated discussions regarding the cost of ColdFusion server (both Standard and Enterprise). Because that topic has been beaten to death I won&#8217;t go into the particulars or the perceived pros and cons of the cost element with ColdFusion.</p>

<p>For me as a ColdFusion developer I want to know that my job (and future) are secure in my current technology of choice. ASP.NET has Microsoft in its corner so you&#8217;d have to assume .NET developers are happy in that regard. PHP has a <em>huge</em> community, a vast array of functionality and an obvious benefit that&#8217;s it free which often comes with extremely cheap hosting. This is paramount for clients in many situations (particularly smaller projects). ColdFusion is my preferred language (I have used ASP 3.0 and PHP in the past) but with the cost of the product even in a shared environment it&#8217;s hard to get clients on board. Yes development time is cut due to ColdFusions RAD nature which translates into real cost savings which could be spent on hosting, but this often seems to be overlooked by potential clients.</p>

<p>I also believe that there is still a notion out there (by people who don&#8217;t know much about ColdFusion, particularly since CFMX) that ColdFusion is NOT a serious solution. Of course we all know that ColdFusion is more than capable of standing up against J2EE, .NET and PHP etc. But how do we (and Adobe) get the message out there?</p>

<p>One way is get ColdFusion as a viable solution and product out there so a LOT of people are using it. Why do so many PHP developers exist when ColdFusion is arguably quicker to develop with and has a rich set of tools available out of the box? Could cost be a reason? Hmmm.</p>

<p>All of a sudden there seems to be a few projects in the running to possibly be a replacement for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion server</a>. Of course New Atlanta&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/index.cfm">Blue Dragon</a> has been around for ages and runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, but best of all it&#8217;s FREE!</p>

<p>There are 2 new FREE players in the market, namely the <a href="http://www.smithproject.org/">Smith Project</a> and <a href="http://www.ignitefusion.com/">IgniteFusion</a>.</p>

<p>From SmithProject:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Smith is a freeware, cross-platform ColdFusion engine, written entirely in Java. Running on the top of Java Runtime Environment and Java Servlet Container, it can be virtually deployed on any operating system and work with any web server. Smith represents lightweight, yet reliable alternative to the existing ColdFusion servers. It supports most important CF features and already drives several large ColdFusion applications.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>From IgniteFusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;IgniteFusion can run ColdFusion scripts without any third-party software. It can also run on any MS Windows platform and only needs 2 MBytes of diskspace.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I imagine these will have a cut down feature set when compared to Blue Dragon (and of course ColdFusion server) but hopefully some momentum will pick up and increase interest in ColdFusion and lower the cost (perhaps altogether!) of Adobe&#8217;s ColdFusion :)</p>

			Do You Know About Alexa Internet?</a>

		<blockquote><p>&#8220;Along the way Alexa has developed an installed based of millions of toolbars, one of the largest Web crawls and an infrastructure to process and serve massive amounts of data.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa Internet</a> was founded in 1996, why does this matter to anyone? Well one reason is their page rankings, often used as an indication of just how popular a web site is. Of course you need to take into account that the statistics provided by Alexa are only available from users (of which there are millions!) who have the Alexa toolbar installed on their browser, this is how the statistics are generated.</p>

<p>The traffic rankings page on their site is quite interesting because it provides stats on things like:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Daily Reach (per million)</p></li>
<li><p>Daily Traffic Rank Trend</p></li>
<li><p>Daily Page Views (per million)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It also gives you a run-down of &#8220;where people are going&#8221; on your site, basically this breaks out all the sub-domains you may have.</p>

<p>At the moment Alexa tells us that <a href="http://ray.camdenfamily.com/">Ray Camden</a> is quite popular with a ranking of 47, 076! Considering Alexa only provide information if your site makes it into the top 100,000 that&#8217;s not bad Ray (also considering that the web now has 1,000,000 web sites!) :)</p>

<p><a href="/images/uploads/2006/11/ray.gif"><img src="/images/uploads/2006/11/ray.thumbnail.gif" alt="ray.camdenfamily.com screen grab from Alexa" /></a></p>

<p>There is an interesting breakdown of traffic on Alexa, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=ray.camdenfamily.com%2F">see here for a breakdown of Ray&#8217;s current traffic</a></p>

<p>One more thing which I found was that <a href="http://fullasagoog.com/">fullasagoog</a> ranked in at 86, 025. Being a blog aggregator I thought it would be a higher rank than Ray&#8217;s site, clearly people visit his site either directly or from other sources/aggregators!</p>

<p>Oh to be a ColdFusion superstar :)</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the fault of the blog software however, it seems the host added some new &#8216;forbidden&#8217; words to their list and of course I wasn&#8217;t notified.</p>

<p>Basically every time I wanted to create or edit a post I was redirected to the host&#8217;s home page! Specifically it looks like the line in question which was causing me headaches was:</p>

<pre><code>$draft-&gt;post_title = sprintf(__('Post # %s'), $draft-&gt;ID);
</code></pre>

<p>I don&#8217;t have time at the moment to set a workaround so I&#8217;ve just commented it out, and as it&#8217;s only for display in my administration area this will be fine for now.</p>

<p>Ah the things that waste what little time you have in a day :(</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The eclipse/cfeclipse combinations makes for a pretty powerfull developing tool for ColdFusion programmers, even those who miss the good old days of using Homesite!</p>

<p>One of the cool things cfeclipse brought over from Homesite is <a href="http://www.cfeclipse.org/go/documentation/user-docs/snippets">snippets</a>, but cfeclipse has a few extra goodies to make them better than ever :)</p>

<p>Whereas in Homesite you would assign a keyboard shortcut directly to a snippet, cfeclipse has an invoke/trigger key combination which stays the same while allowing you to use ANY key(s) as the actual trigger text for the snippet.</p>

<p>For example I have a cfabort snippet with a trigger text of &#8216;a&#8217;. Now in eclipse 3.2 the invoke/trigger combination is ctrl + j, so if I type the letter &#8216;a&#8217;, then press ctrl + j I get a lovely cfabort tag! Doing things this way allows me to have the same invoke key (ctrl + j) then simply remember my trigger text for each snippet. Nice :)</p>

<p>In common with Homesite is the idea of snippet variables, most handy if your snippet text requires or relies upon a user defined parameter value. An example here is cfinclude where you must specify the &#8216;template&#8217; attribute.</p>

<p>To setup snippet variables you use the $${variable:default} format. My trigger text is &#8216;i&#8217; for cfinclude, so when I invoke the snippet I get asked to enter a parameter value as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/uploads/2006/10/snippet.jpg" alt="cfeclipse snippet variable" /></p>

<p>My entire snippet looks like this: <cfinclude template="$${template:.cfm}" />></p>

<p>There are a number of built in snippet variables:</p>

<p>$${DATE}
$${MONTH}
$${TIME}
$${DATETIME}
$${DAYOFWEEK}
$${CURRENTFILE} - Current file name (just the file)
$${CURRENTFOLDER} - Current folder (The path to the containing folder)
$${CURRENTPATH} - Current path (full file name)
$${CURRENTPRJPATH} - Just the folder
$${USERNAME} - Current user
$${MONTHNUMBER} - Month as a number
$${DAYOFMONTH} - Day of month as a number
$${DAYOFWEEKNUMBER} - Day of week (the week starts on Sunday)
$${DATETIME24} - DateTime24 - a 24 hour clock version of datetime.
$${YEAR} - Current year.
$${YEAR2DIGIT} - Current two digit year.</p>

<p>Other than those, you&#8217;re free to name your variables as you wish.</p>

<p>Another SUPER cool feature is the ability to choose a default value from a range. So for my cflocation snippet I have:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;cflocation url="$${url:.cfm}" addToken="$${addToken:false|true}" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the use of the pipe (|). There is even more than this on the cfeclipse.org site so take a peek. Some of the snippets I use are:</p>

<p>cfabort
cfcomment
cfdump
cfinclude
cflocation
cfoutput
cfquery
cfscript
html comment (used with xml files)</p>

<p>I also use tonnes of snippets for HTML, (strong, em etc). Using snippets is easy to learn and saves you a LOT of time when you&#8217;re used to invoking them with ease!</p>

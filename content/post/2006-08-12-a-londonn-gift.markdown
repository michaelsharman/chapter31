[Carl Orr](http://www.carlorr.com) is in town but only for a few days. Carl is truly a special guitarist and an old teacher of mine. In fact I even did his original wesite waaaay back in the day (please forgive it now!). Carl has been living in London for about 10 years so it was a long time coming considering I used to see him play almost every other week in the mid 90's.




The gig was at the Seymour Centre and was put on my the good fellows at [SIMA](http://www.sima.org). It was the first time I've been there and it's a really nice 'club', I liked it and will be back!




Also I ran into a friend of mine from UNI days which was a nice surprise.

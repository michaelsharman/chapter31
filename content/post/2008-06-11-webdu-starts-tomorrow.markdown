Looking forward to another [WebDU](http://www.webdu.com.au/) starting tomorrow in beautiful Sydney.

Geoff, Julie and the rest of the [Daemon](http://www.daemon.com.au/) gang have brought us yet another stella cast of speakers. Judging from the [agenda](http://www.webdu.com.au/go/agenda/agenda-at-a-glance/agenda-at-a-glance) I'm going to have trouble knowing which session to attend, but that's always a good thing.

Also can't wait for the first evening party, something different this year to help everyone meet and greet.

I hope to see (and meet) some new faces and hopefully not be too worn out on Friday for day 2 :)

See you all tomorrow!
